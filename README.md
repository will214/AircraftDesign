# AircraftDesign
In the context of my final project in Aerospace Engineering at Polytechnique Montr√©al, our team had to design a family of two aircrafts of 76 and 100 passengers. The optimization for geometry, performance, weights and costs was elaborated on MATLAB. Here are a few files from the whole project.
